# Buildroot post-build hook: merge the extracted vendor runtime into the target.
#
# The proprietary pieces fpvOS cannot ship (AR8030 baseband userland + firmware,
# libmali, librga) are fetched by scripts/extract-ascent-vrx-pro-firmware.py into vendor/rootfs/.
# They are laid over the target here rather than through BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY so
# that a build with NO vendor blobs still succeeds: CI builds the open tree
# without them and the image simply comes up with kestrel unable to reach the
# radio or the GPU until they are supplied.
#
# $1 is TARGET_DIR (Buildroot passes it).

#                      Remove this exclusion to fall back to the vendor blob

# Vendor files fpvOS does not ship at all, even when an extraction carries them
# (dropped by the case in the loop below):
#
#   ar_fpv_upgrade   - stock's firmware upgrade agent, which writes the NAND.
#                      fpvOS upgrades by reflashing the card.
#   factory_mount.sh - stock's /factory mount, which ubiformats the NAND
#                      partition when a mount fails. S50factory reads it
#                      read-only instead.
#
# With ar-libre (arlink.ko in the target), Artosyn's radio host stack is not
# shipped either: arlink.ko, its library and bb_only.sh replace the stock
# driver, the client library and the daemon. Only the chip's own firmware and
# config are still Artosyn's.

# /factory/user_cfg.json is the goggle's pairing list: the bb_mac_addr_N
# entries are the air units it may link with. kestrel seeds BB_SET_CANDIDATES
# from it, and its bind menu adds to it.
#
# The image does not need to carry one. At every boot S50factory merges in the
# air units stock has paired, read from the goggle's own NAND, and a unit
# never paired under stock is bound once from the menu. A copy pulled with
# `extract-ascent-vrx-pro-firmware.py --from-device` still lands here via the merge below, but
# only for a build meant for that one goggle - never ship it in a release.
