fpvOS replaces the stock firmware on the **Caddx Ascent VRX Pro** with an open
one, drawn on the goggle's GPU. The fpvOS air image opens up the Ascent Lite and
Lite+ too, and the radio between them runs an open firmware on both ends,
[Open8030](https://github.com/gehee/Open8030) by [mh1412](https://github.com/mh1412).

## Why fly it

<table>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><b>Low latency, and it stays there.</b><br><br><b>27.5 ms</b> median glass to glass (<b>25 ms</b> with screen tearing): an Ascent Lite+ with the fpvOS air image at 864p120, and a VRX Pro driving a 120 Hz screen. Measured with an LED in front of the camera and a photodiode on the screen (<a href="docs/LATENCY.md">details</a>). No keyframe spikes, and each picture is decoded as its slices arrive.<br><br>The stats screen shows it live: latency per stage, frame pacing, the link and temperatures.</td>
<td align="center"><img src="assets/stats.webp" alt="The stats screen" width="440"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><b>A HUD that flies with you.</b><br><br>A GPU scene that banks with the aircraft, from the camera's IMU or the flight controller's gyro, over your Betaflight OSD. Turn it on or off, or choose how far it moves, in <b>HUD › Dynamic HUD</b>.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><b>Let your friends watch.</b><br><br>Phones join the VRX's WiFi and open <code>192.168.4.1</code>: your live view, HUD and all, and your recordings. No app.</td>

The goal is zero regressions: anything stock does, fpvOS should do. The full
tour is in the [user guide](docs/GUIDE.md); questions in the [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md).

## Install in three steps

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/install-steps.svg" alt="1. Flash a microSD card. 2. Put it in the goggle and power on. 3. Link up and fly." width="1000">
</div>

1. **Write** [`fpvOS-vrxpro-<version>.img.xz`](https://github.com/gehee/fpvOS/releases/latest)
   from the latest release to a microSD card (2 GB or more) with
   [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/), as it is: no unpacking.
2. **Put the card in the goggle and power it on.** The fpvOS idle screen means
   you're on fpvOS.
3. **Fly.** A stock Ascent air unit links right away, and stays bound.

Nothing is written to the goggle itself: **pull the card and it boots exactly
as before.** Step by step: **[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)**.

**Optional, the air unit:** the fpvOS air image (Lite and Lite+) makes the
latency steady and adds end-to-end measurements, the reactive HUD and flight
controller telemetry. Flash it from Chrome or Edge with the
**[fpvOS Flasher](https://gehee.github.io/fpvOS_flasher/)**; Caddx's own
update takes it back. Read [the air unit guide](docs/INSTALL.md#flash-the-air-unit-optional)
first: it's the one step that writes to your hardware.

## Compatibility

| Device | Stock firmware | fpvOS |
|---|---|---|
| **Caddx Ascent VRX Pro** (goggle) | — | ✅ boots from the SD card |
| **Caddx Ascent Lite** (air, CV2004, IMU) | ✅ links to fpvOS | ✅ fpvOS air image |
| **Caddx Ascent Lite+** (air, OS02K10) | ✅ links to fpvOS | ✅ fpvOS air image |
| **Caddx Ascent VRX / Gnd485** (AR9311 receiver) | — | Experimental platform support; see below |

[What the fpvOS air image adds](docs/FAQ.md#what-the-fpvos-air-image-adds) over a stock air unit.

**AR9311 development:** the Gnd485 profile builds Linux 6.18 with hardware
decoding, fixed-mode HDMI and an SDIO radio interface. It provides bench tools,
not the integrated Kestrel ground application. Installed systems boot from NAND
and run their root filesystem in RAM. Initial bring-up and recovery use the
existing U-Boot USB RAM loader; NAND installation is an explicit operation.
The SD-card installation instructions above do not apply to this receiver.
See [building and testing AR9311](docs/AR9311.md).

## Before you fly

fpvOS is **beta** software, and it runs the video link you fly by.

- **Keep a stock card handy.** Swapping cards is your fallback.
- **A freeze or a dropout mid-flight can cost you the aircraft, or worse.**
  Bench-test it, then fly line-of-sight or over open ground until you trust it.
- **RF compliance is your responsibility.** Check your country's rules for 5 GHz
  video transmitters.
- **The WiFi access point is 2.4 GHz,** off at every boot. Switched on, it sits
  next to a 2.4 GHz RC link: plug in an external antenna and range-test first.
- **No warranty.** Provided as is, at your own risk: sections 15 and 16 of the
  [GPLv3](LICENSE).

Built on Artosyn's AR8030 and Caddx's Ascent, with thanks. Thank you to [mh1412](https://github.com/mh1412) for [Open8030](https://github.com/gehee/Open8030), the open radio firmware fpvOS runs on both ends. [GPLv3](LICENSE), details in [About](docs/ABOUT.md#license).

**fpvOS**: the goggle is open now.
